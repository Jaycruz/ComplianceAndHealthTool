This tool is a modification from another Github/MacAdmin members swiftDialog code, with some modifications that include a scoring health system. 
Simple, effective and easy for your users to use and report to their IT team. You could modify the button to include information from this application when creating a ticket if you wanted to get that nitty gritty on it. 

You do need to install swiftDialog from here: https://swiftdialog.app/ to get this to work. 
Easy to deploy this to machines using JAMF, but you can have users install this directly too if you prefer. 

Also, the "macOS x.x Beta" operating system check may not work, so if a user is running macOS Beta, it might actually say it's not up to date. Play with the code a bit and let me know what to fix. 
Join the MacAdmins Slack workspace, its a nice group of people there.
