This tool is a modification from another Github/MacAdmin members code, with some modifications that include a scoring health system. 
Simple, effective and easy for your users to use and report to their IT team. You could modify the button to include information from this application when creating a ticket if you wanted to get that nitty gritty on it. 
Lemme know what you guys think, and if you find the user who created the original template for this, please let me know and I will credit them.

Also, the Beta version for MacOS may not work, so if a user is running Beta, it might actually say it's not up to date. Play with the code a bit and let me know what to fix. 
Join the MacAdmins Slack workspace, its a nice group of people there.
